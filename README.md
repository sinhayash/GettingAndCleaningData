#Course Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" by John Hopkins University
##The project contains only one script ,namely "run_analysis.R".

Following are the steps the script performs
1. First of all it loads the data from the working directory and merges it into one data table
2. Then it extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement called data_mean.
3. Then it uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. It appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Finally, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
